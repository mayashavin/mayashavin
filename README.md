Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Maya and I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, with a unique blend of an MBA, M.Sc in Computer Science, and a BA in Economics. Specializing in the web development, my skills stretch across TypeScript, Vue, React, CSS, and more. Beyond coding, I'm an [international speaker](https://mayashavin.com/speaker) and published author, advocating passionately for web development, UX/UI, Accessibility, and robust coding standards. And recently, AI and LLM services catch my attention 😉.

Besides speaking at conferences, I often blog about my coding journey, and share my experience not only about the Web development but also about other aspect of software engineering on [my personal site](https://mayashavin.com/articles). Also certainly, contributing to open-source projects, whenever I can.

I am also a GDE - Google Developer Expert on Web technologies, Nuxt Ambassador and a Cloudinary Ambassador. When I am not coding, I cultivate [the Vuejs Israel community](https://vuejsisrael.com) and balance my time with [illustrating adorable characters](https://instagram.com/hippopyart) with my three little kids.

If you like my work, [support me with a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/VTLRKH6) 😉.

[Maya Shavin portfolio](https://mayashavin.com/) - Where I share my experience and practice for web development, testing, UI/UX, accessibility through writing, and other information like podcasts I did as guests, talk videos, my conference schedule, etc.

## 👩‍🎨 Illustration as a hobby

I love illustrating cute things when I have free time (which is very limited) and make cute merchs out of them. You can check out some of my drawings on [Instagram - HippopyArt](https://www.instagram.com/hippopyart), or [my Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/hippopy) for some cute stationery and stickers.

And obviously, no Midjourney 😉!
